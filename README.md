# IBM-Employee-Attrition-and-HR-Analytics-Using-SQL

#### **📌 Project Overview**  
Employee attrition is a major challenge for companies, affecting costs, productivity, and overall workplace morale. In this project, I analyze employee data to understand **why employees leave**, what factors contribute the most to attrition, and how businesses can improve retention strategies.  

Using **SQL**, I explore key patterns related to **salary, promotions, work-life balance, and job roles** to provide meaningful insights.

#### **🔍 Why This Project?**  
There are many datasets available, but I chose the **IBM HR Analytics** dataset because:  
✔️ It contains real-world HR data with key employee attributes.  
✔️ Understanding attrition is a **valuable business problem** with real-world impact.  
✔️ The dataset allows me to practice **advanced SQL techniques** like **window functions, joins, and aggregations**.

#### **🛠 How I Solved It**  
✅ **Data Cleaning & Exploration:** Filtered and structured key attributes like attrition status, department, salary, and work-life balance.  
✅ **Complex SQL Queries:**  
   - Used **window functions** (RANK) to analyze salary rankings within departments.  
   - **JOIN operations** to compare individual employee data with company-wide averages.  
   - **Aggregations & filtering** to identify trends in promotions, overtime, and job roles.  
✅ **Insights Generated:**  
   - Employees with **low work-life balance and fewer promotions** had higher attrition rates.  
   - **Overtime** significantly impacted attrition.  
   - Employees earning **below the department’s average salary** were more likely to leave.
